# Data Science Analytics Course: Swedish Housing Market Prediction

This repository contains Andres Cruz (me) and Wilma Lilljequist's project from a Data Science Analytics course, where we developed a predictive model for the Swedish housing market using Python. The project covers:

	•	Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting meaningful features to enhance model performance.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms to forecast housing prices.
