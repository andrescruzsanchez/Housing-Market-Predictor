# Data Science Analytics Course: Swedish Housing Market Prediction

This repository contains my project from a Data Science Analytics course, where I developed a predictive model for the Swedish housing market using Python. The project covers the full data science pipeline, including:

	•	SQL Querying: Extracting and preprocessing housing market data.
	•	Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting meaningful features to enhance model performance.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning algorithms to forecast housing prices.

The data files used for this project are too large for GitHub, but can be shared upon request. Please contact me if you are interested in accessing the data files.
